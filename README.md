# drone_optimize
Optimize the design parameters of a drone with Genetic Algorithm. The objective is to maximize the working duration of the drone.
The simulation is written in MATLAB. The propeller is simulated using Blade Element Theory. A list of motors and batteries are used for optimization. 

The design variables to be optimized are:
1. Batter label
2. Motor label
3. Propeller pitch angle
4. Propeller number of blades
5. Propeller radius
6. Propeller width
7. Ascend speed up acceleration
8. Ascend speed down acceleration
9. Descend speed up acceleration
10. Tranlational speed up / slow down acceleration
